## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
If I got stuck on or wanted to know more about functionality and sytax of Jacascript or CSS, I googled through StackOverFlow, w3schools.com and also at FreeCodeCamp.ord where I have been learning HTML, CSS and Java script and trying to finish their certificates as well.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
There were not many problems in creating basic functions for this Game. I was able to do the whole basic Game and coding smoothly after going through basics that I have been learning on FreeCodeCamp.org. I did have the challenge of adding sound with click on buttons. I saw the tutorial and got familiar with the stuff that plays sound in HTML with Functions of JavaScript. However I was messing up my whole Guess game when I tried to play with my startTone and stopTone functions. I was able to add sound to the buttons after reading posts on Stackoverflow and doing some random search on Google and reading stuff about it. Then I was not able to stop the sound on time with clueTime for some reasons and I knew I had some bugs in my Code that I had to debug. Later, I was not able to find any appropriate 1 second sounds because the other longer sounds were playing for too long and not stopping. I am still working on it and will try to finish before the due date of Assignment If I will get free time from my Exams. Either way I will do it just to learn it even If I miss the deadline as It was challenging and I love to solve Challenges. However I did add sound after losing or Winning games and that was something new too for me. I am also working on Ticking Clock and the challenge for me was to actually display the clock because I wanted to display it like Animated not just numbers. I wanted to display it like a real watch on the wall. So I am learning and researching about that as well.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
There are many question that arise in my mind about Web development. I wonder how can we combine backend with frontend. We can create web pages just with HTML, CSS and JavaScript so where does the backend come in here or can we even use our algorithms and structure that I learned through Object Oriented programming with C++ in Web development. I wonder what things we can do the backend and frontend together. Javascript was new for me but I am familiar with C++ so I didn't had hard time understanding Javascript because logic is the most important thing for me, We can easily learn the new language from one to another. Web development seems really interesting because of how easily we can create buttons and design it with CSS but when we add logic and functionality to it through JavaScript, it can easily start getting messy as if we keep adding functions and creativity in it. So what are the ways we can manage that much data and functionality with big websites that are using Javascript, like how can we manage it better? Does backend comes in handy here or do we use databases to handle data? There are many things that I need to clear and I think more I will work with it more clear it will become.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had few ore hours, I would try make this game  more interesting by adding Animated clock that I will definitely finish it and try to do it in my free time and it will be a great way of learning for me as for CSS and JavaSCript. Other features, I would add High score counter that will display user high scores and keeps the data that how many times user tried and what scored user got at each try. I would also like to read more on Sound Synthesis functions and get better undersatnding of it. I would like to make it more complicated and every time user starts an game, they will see different number of buttons. Let's say if you start the gme firt time, you will see 9 buttons to follow the pattern and if user lost and wants to play again, User will click on start new game and will see different number of buttons in there like 6. Then user have follow clues on those 6 colorful buttons.
